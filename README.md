# ECE-366
It contains all of my codes from Computer Organization class

Project 2 =  This python simulator accepts hexadecimalcode and converts it into assembly landuage. It also prints about the values in each of the registers and memory locations.

Project 3  = This project takes the hexadecimal instructions as an input and executes out hardcoded ISA in python. It then prints the values contained int he registers and memory locations.
             It also print the branch counter and the memory instruction counter. This project gave us the best instuctions count compared to the rest of the class.
       
Project 4  = This projects takes the hexadecimal instructions and few other user paramerts to execute. 
             It asked the user would like to run multi-cycle, fast pipeline or slow pipeline and if the user woule like the debug mode one or off.
             It also asked the user for the size of the cache.
             At the end of the execution it prints the number of hits, missed and hit/miss accuracy occured after implementing the cache.
             it also gives breakdown of line by line instuctions in assembly language.
